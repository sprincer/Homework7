              <p>  Story: I'd type a story, but a really good one comes to mind, and I
      would rather let Chuck Palahniuk tell it than me try to type out all of the details.
      I'll try to link the time exactly but if it doesn't work goto: 17:12
      <a href="https://youtu.be/cvPQjL4wDIY?t=1032">Chuck Palahniuk's Story</a></p>
              <p>  I recommend watching the rest of that video but the other stories are a little
        rougher than that one. Hopefully you enjoy?
